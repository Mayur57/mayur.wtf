# Mosaic

![Vercel](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=portfolio-v2-plum-two)

Mosaic is a super-fast, no-nonsense, and intricately desgined portfolio website built from scratch for performance. A complete rewrite of the previous bare HTML/CSS [portfolio website](https://old.mayurbhoi.com) to Next.js.

**Why name it Mosaic?**
A person's portfolio is a culmination of several different experiences and their work. A mosaic of smaller bits, and this, is my **_mosaic_**.

## TODO

- [ ] Write about environment variables and other important development details (frameworks, packages, CMS) used in README
- [ ] Document colors for the light and dark color themes in README
- [ ] Define brand colors in a single file and use it
- [x] Add support for Cloudinary and serve images via the CDN
- [x] Split multiple components defined in a single file to their own files
- [x] Clean up code and remove redundant, unused code
