# v1

![Vercel](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=portfolio-v2-plum-two)

A complete rewrite of the previous bare HTML/CSS [portfolio website](https://old.mayurbhoi.com) to Next.js.

## TODO
I know the app is bit unoptimised and lot of the code can be trimmed and cleaned up. There are many code blocks that were features planned previously but aren't prioritised for now or have been cancelled completely. Hence, for now, the project is in maintenance mode to streamline the code base and focus on efficiency and best practices. This will be an ongoing exercise with a soft ETA of August, 2023 but there is no hard commitment. Till then, no new/planned features will be implemented.

## Stack

Next.js + Chakra UI deployed via Vercel
