# v2

![Vercel](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=portfolio-v2-plum-two)

A complete rewrite of the previous bare HTML/CSS [portfolio website](https://old.mayurbhoi.com) to Next.js.

## Roadmap

### v2.6.0
The site will shift away from CMS-based content serving and will start adopting [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) for Nextjs as the source of static content. Thus, deploying the website will completely remove setting up an additional server for hosting a CMS. This task will be shipped in v2.6.0.

### v2.7.0
At the moment, the website uses [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for styling and theme management. This will change going forward and the website will incrementally start utilising [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. This change will ship in v2.7.0

### v2.7.x and beyond
I know the app is bit unoptimised and lot of the code can be trimmed and cleaned up. There are many code blocks that were features planned previously but aren't prioritised for now or have been cancelled completely. Hence, for now, the project is in maintenance mode to streamline the code base and focus on efficiency and best practices. This will be an ongoing exercise with a soft ETA of end of 2023 but there is no hard commitment. Till then, no new features will be implemented.
