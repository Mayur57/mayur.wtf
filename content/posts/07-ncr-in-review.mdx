Biggest lesson Iâ€™ve learned in the last 6 months: Most of coding at a company is just FINDING where to change the code. although it is certainly more exciting to work on new projects using cutting edge technologies, jobs at the entry level mostly deal with legacy code written years or possibly even over a decade ago. maintaining code bases is as important as building new features.

bigger picture

loose deadlines

- learn git commands even advance ones
- embrace failures
- time management
- ask for help
- ask for feedback and take it well
- communicate well
- read and write documentation
