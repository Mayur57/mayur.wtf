In the past, I have struggled with appreciating my achievements and hard work. I have always been laser-focused on completing the next goal and held myself to the highest standards with no exceptions. When I didn't achieve my goals, an unforgiving voice bugged me to try again and get it right. Even after achieving goals, there has always been a realisation that I could've done better. I had never stopped to notice the journey I had covered so far and instead always worried about the upcoming challenges. I may have been too harsh on myself.

Wins is an experiment to change this behaviour and appreciate the achievements in life, big or small. Previously, I have been noting them in the notes app on my phone, but achievements are meant to be worn as a medal of pride and deserve to be shown to the world. This also helps me lift myself up when I sometimes, inevitably, feel discouraged, lost, or doubt myself or my capabilities. Wins will be there when you want to celebrate your wins or reflect on how far you've come.

Wins features a simple way to document your achievements as a singular Markdown file. It can be self-hosted if you wish to show it off on the internet. Just use Vercel to one-click deploy your achievements page.

Remember to be kind to yourself and keep pushing!
