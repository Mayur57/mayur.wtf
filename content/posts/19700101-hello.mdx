Hey. Glad you're here.

I'll be using this space to share interesting things I come across on a variety of topics, including computers, science, math, and philosophy. These might sometimes include my own thoughts and opinions on these topics.

Many [tech influencers](https://twitter.com/trashh_dev/status/1604864610347229185) prioritise engagement and growth over sharing deep and meaningful content, but I'm not trying to be a tech influencer and this isn't Twitter.

I can't promise that I'll be regular with my posts, but I can assure you that the content I do share will be useful and of high quality.

I hope you find it valuable.
